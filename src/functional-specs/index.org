  shown in the pages where there is a scope to
  filter/sort/export the populated data
- On click of user chosen action on the grid view
  appropriate action should be performed and display the
  data.
For example in workshop history details page we should be
able to filter/sort the data location wise, highest/lowest
usage wise, alphabatical wise, date wise etc.,

** Specification 5 (Other)
- Should update the footer in portal  
- Fix/remove broken links if exists
- Currently the outreach home page and in the pages where
  the data is getting populated is taking more time to load
  than expected which is hampering the user experience in
  terms of performance. It must load within 2-3 seconds on a
  2G connection for a better experience.
