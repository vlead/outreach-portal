* Introduction
  This document elaborates the design incorporated while building or
  implementing the [[https://outreach.vlabs.ac.in][=outreach portal=]].  This document is incrementally dilating
  due to the tight cycle between design and implementation.  This cycle is
  established to satisfy the requirement of making short releases of working
  and demonstrable software.

* Design of the Outreach Portal
  Outreach Portal is both a web application and a service.  The software that
  is bundled and deployed performs the twin tasks of providing user interface
  and performing business logic.

** Map Locators

  [[https://developers.google.com/maps/][Google Map API]] is used to mark nodal centers on the Indian map in this
  application.  A =key= is part of the request parameters of the google map
  api. 

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  <script type="text/javascript" 
    src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=API_KEY">
  </script>
  #+END_EXAMPLE

  This =key= is given by Google following a request identified by an email is
  made using a [[https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=outreach-portal&authuser=1&duration=PT1H][dash board]].  This key can be used across applications that make
  up the platform of =Virtual Labs= to access google map api.  This is done by
  setting the =allowed referrers= to urls originating from /vlabs.ac.in/.

  This key is exposed in the browser.  Is there a way to secure this key?
  Exposing the key is the [[https://github.com/drewjw81/meteor-googlemaps/issues/6][practice]].  The key is [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8729976/does-google-maps-javascript-api-key-v3-need-to-be-kept-secret-in-html-checked][secured]] by setting =allowed
  referrers= when generating it so that the key can't be used by services
  outside the =allowed referrers=.
