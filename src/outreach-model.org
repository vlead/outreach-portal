** Model Diagram
   The model-diagram can be found below. This gives an overview of the
   relationships between different entities.

   [[https://github.com/vlead/outreach-portal/blob/master/outreach-model-diagram.jpg][Model-diagram]] 

   This diagram highlights the following facts:

   + An outreach coordinator can have multiple nodal coordinators
     associated with it.

   + An outreach coordinator can conduct multiple nodal coordinator
     trainings.

   + Each nodal centre is assigned to a unique nodal coordinator.
 
   + A nodal coordinator can conduct multiple workshops.

   + A workshop report is unique to a workshop and there can not be
     multiple reports for a single workshop.

   + Each workshop report can have multiple workshop photos.

   + The workshop document is a separate entity and is only used by an
     admin.

* Operations of the application
  + The outreach coordinators would broadly do the following operations
    through this portal:

    - Add Nodal Centres.
    - Assign new or existing nodal coordinators to nodal centres.
    - Set targets for nodal coordinators.
    - Approve/reject workshop reports and comment on them.
    - Add a nodal coordinator training workshop

  + The nodal coordinators would perform the following operations:

    - Create/edit/delete workshop.
    - Submit/edit workshop report.

  + Besides these users, an admin is part of the system and the
    application assumes who the admin is. He can upload the relevant
    workshop documents and add outreach coordinators. 

* Link to wireframes 
  A skeletal of the front-end is given below in different use-case
  scenarios:

  [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/outreach-portal/blob/master/vlead-effort/wireframes/Vlabs%20Outreach%20Portal%20design-%20Wireframes.pdf][Wireframes]]

* Quality Parameters
  Following standard practices need to be strictly observed:

  + Issue tracking should be done via Github portal.
  + The function and variable names should be relevant along with
    proper casing.(Camel case or upper case)
  + Complete code should be properly indented.
  + There should be relevant comments in the code.
  + The database tables should be normalized.
  + The application should be properly secured from common web attacks
    such as SQL injection.
  + The directory structure of the different folders should be proper
    and the documents should be checked in relevant folders only.
